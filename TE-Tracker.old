# SVfinder Configuration file

# The [GLOBAL] section sets global parameters that are relevant to the entire pipeline.
#
# basedir		is the install directory where the SVfinder binaries are stored
#
# rms_command		is the command that is used to submit a job through your local
#  	       		RMS system. Ask your system administrator or leave blank if unsure.
#
# rms_args		is the default parameters to be passed to the rms_command. Leave
#  	       		blank if unsure.
#
# highmem_launch	is the command that will replace rms_command [rms_args] when executing
# 			memory-intensive tasks. Please refer to the man page for information
#			about how much memory SVfinder uses. If left blank, rms_command [rms_args]
#			will be used.
#
# highmem_thresh	is the size threshold, in kB, for the cluster files. Above this size limit
# 			the clustering will be considered memory-intensive and highmem_launch will
#			be run. The default value of 20 corresponds to an approximate 6Go peak
#			memory usage.

# The three processing steps specify the default behaviour of each of the steps in the SVfinder pipeline.
# Changes in the following sections will impact only the corresponding step, and you will still be able to
# override these parameters with your main SVfinder call.
#
# binary    	       is the name of the binary or script file that will be run when the corresponding
# 		       step is called. Although you can change this parameter to replace pipeline elements
#		       with your own scripts, it is advised to proceed with caution and ensure compatibility
